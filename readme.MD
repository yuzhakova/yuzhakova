### Welcome to my GitHub!
### I'm Natalia, Vancouver based Business Analyst.
### Last year I have completed a full-stack Web Development Bootcamp Program at [Lighthouse Labs](https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/en/web-development-bootcamp), took time to practice and now I am ready for my next step!
### Through continuous self-study I have been building a solid foundation in both front-end and back-end technologies, focusing on Product Management and Data Visualization.

- 🔭  I’m working on improving my techskills and becoming better at coding
- 🌱  I continue to learn how to combine powerful visualization components and a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation. My current focus: JS, D3.js, React.js, HTML, SVG, CSS
- 👯  I’m looking for new and exciting opportunities to use my previous experience and newly acquired skills
- 🥅  2021 Goal: find a hybrid role in Web Development/Product Management/Business Analysis
